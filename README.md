###### To use google sheet, you'll have to get Google Drive API, credentials and a JSON file which you have to load later
###### I followed the first steps of the following post https://erikrood.com/Posts/py_gsheets.html


## Todo:
- [ ] create dependency list and installation guide
- [X] get the google sheets name and the sevice account JSON file from an entry and print the text there, new lines to new rows
- [ ] coordinate input limits to screen size
- [ ] load image instead of the screenshot
- [ ] make the selecetion with a mouse instead of the boring coordinates
